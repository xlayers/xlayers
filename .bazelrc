# Don't create any symlinks in the project directory.
# Ideally we'd create a symlink from dist -> $(bazel info bazel-bin)
# so that the dist/ folder gets populated approx. the same as before
# but there are two problems:
# - Bazel will still create a /bazel-out symlink, which needs to be carefully ignored in the editor
# - You'll get dist/bin/ instead of just dist/

# compiler running as daemons, and cache SourceFile AST's to reduce parse time.
